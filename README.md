# IBI / IBU VM orchestration

This repo provides the framework for running Image Base Upgrade (IBU) and
Installation (IBI) on libvirt virtual machines for development, debugging and
experimentation purposes.

Usage:

- [IBI Usage](README.ibi.md)
- [IBU Usage](README.ibu.md)

## Requirements

For running some of the options in the makefile you might need the following packages:

- `virt-install`
- `nmstate`

Remember to define `PULL_SECRET` not pointing to the file containing it but to the full secret itself, you can convert from the file to the variable by running:

```sh
export PULL_SECRET="$(jq -c . ~/openshift_pull.json)"
```

That will load file contents with jq in compact form and store it in that environment variable.
